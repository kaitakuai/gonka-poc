"""Exception-path unit tests for ``init_generate``'s gate-cleanup contract.

Background -- the v3 architecture re-review (Stream B fixture issue) flagged
that ``init_generate`` flips the PoC gate ON *before* it has a generation
task whose done-callback would flip it OFF. If anything between
``gate.activate(...)`` and ``gen_task.add_done_callback(...)`` raises:

    gate.activate("init-generate")           # ON
    compat = _current()                      # <-- may raise
    aborted = await compat.abort_all_requests(...)  # <-- may raise
    gen_task = asyncio.create_task(...)      # <-- may raise

...the gate latches ON forever -- no task exists yet, so no done-callback
ever fires the corresponding ``gate.deactivate()``. The HTTP server then
503s every chat/completion request from that point on, with no way back.

The Stream B fix wraps the three offending calls in a try/except that
calls ``gate.deactivate()`` on any exception before re-raising. These
tests pin that contract:

  * test_init_generate_compat_raises_deactivates_gate
        ``gonka_poc.poc.routes._current`` raises RuntimeError.
        Expected: gate ends up DEACTIVATED, exception propagates.

  * test_init_generate_abort_raises_deactivates_gate
        ``compat.abort_all_requests`` raises RuntimeError.
        Expected: gate ends up DEACTIVATED, exception propagates.

  * test_init_generate_spawn_raises_deactivates_gate
        ``asyncio.create_task`` raises RuntimeError (or the inner
        ``_generation_loop`` raises before yielding -- either path lands
        in the same try-block).
        Expected: gate ends up DEACTIVATED, exception propagates.

If Stream B has landed, these tests pass. If Stream D landed first
(this file with no production fix), every test fails -- and that IS the
gate working: the failures localize the missing fix to one production
path instead of a tail of integration symptoms.

Why no ``vllm`` import / engine: the gate object is a pure-Python flag
defined in ``gonka_poc.entrypoint.gating``; we mount a minimal FastAPI
app with just enough state for ``_get_gate`` to find it. ``engine_client``
is a Mock that survives a single ``getattr(...)`` lookup. This keeps the
test CPU-only and < 1s.

    branch deactivated the gate and re-raised -- but never set
    ``stop_event`` and never cancelled the callback task. Result: an orphan

    stop_event + bounded-waits + cancels. This test pins that behaviour by
    asserting the callback task is ``done()`` (cancelled or naturally
    exited) after the exception unwinds. If the bug regresses the task

    ``aiohttp.ClientSession`` and starts hitting the network. We do not want
    real I/O in a unit test, so we replace the class with a tiny stand-in
