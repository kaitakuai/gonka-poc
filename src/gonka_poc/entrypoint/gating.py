"""PoCGatingMiddleware -- 503 + abort-in-flight on PoC priority gate.

Modeled on ``vllm/entrypoints/serve/elastic_ep/middleware.py:ScalingMiddleware``
(v0.23.0). When PoC generation is active, new chat/completion requests get a
503 response BEFORE reaching any vLLM handler.

In-flight aborts: a Starlette middleware cannot directly cancel a
``StreamingResponse`` that has already begun yielding bytes. The companion
shutdown path is the explicit ``EngineClient.abort_request(request_id)``
call issued from the PoC router itself (see ``api_router.py``) right before
GPU work starts. The middleware is purely a "don't accept new work" gate.

    OUTERMOST -- it runs before any vLLM handler.

    Doubles as the carrier for the one-shot "plugin loaded but no gate

    v0.23.0 ``api_server.py``), and Starlette silently ignores ``on_event``
    handlers when a ``lifespan`` is supplied (FastAPI has deprecated this
    pattern since 0.93). To keep the warning fail-loud across both
    ``vllm serve`` and ``gonka-vllm-serve``, we now perform the check on the
